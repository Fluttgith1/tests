# Fetch the super_editor mono repo.
fetch=git clone https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor.git tests
fetch=git -C tests checkout bc121ccefcb40fd9dd1517784b89c6786be843d0

# Run the tests.
test.posix=./flutter_test_registry/flutter_test_repo_test.sh
test.windows=.\flutter_test_registry\flutter_test_repo_test.bat

# To test your tests, check out the flutter/flutter repository and
# then, from the root of that repository, run:
#
#   bin/flutter; cd dev/customer_testing; flutter pub get; time ../../bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart run_tests.dart --repeat=100 <path>
#
# ...where <path> is the path to this file.
#
# This should run with no output, without failing, and should in total
# take less than 15 minutes (a hundred runs of your tests taking just
# a few seconds each). If your tests take longer, mention this in your
# PR and we will evaluate them to see how valuable they are (e.g. how
# unique and different they are compared to other tests we already
# have). The more valuable the tests, the more likely we are to accept
# them despite them taking a long time to run.
